## My process

1. **Setup**: I started by setting up the project structure, including downloading the starter folder and creating css file.

2. **HTML Markup**: I wrote the HTML markup, ensuring to use semantic tags to improve accessibility and readability.

3. **CSS Styling**: I created the CSS file and defined custom properties for colors, fonts, and other styles. I also included a CSS reset to ensure consistency across browsers.

4. **Layout with Flexbox and Grid**: I used Flexbox and CSS Grid to create responsive layouts. This involved defining grid templates and flex properties to align and distribute elements properly.

5. **Responsive Design**: I added media queries to adjust the layout and styles for different screen sizes, ensuring the page looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

6. **Testing and Debugging**: I tested the page on different browsers and devices to ensure it works as expected. I also debugged any issues that arose during testing.

7. **Final Touches**: I added final touches, such as custom fonts, list styling, and other minor adjustments to improve the overall look and feel of the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained valuable experience in several areas:

1. **Semantic HTML5 Markup**: I learned the importance of using semantic HTML tags to improve the accessibility and readability of the code. For example, using `<section>` and `<div>` tags appropriately.

2. **CSS Custom Properties**: I utilized CSS custom properties (variables) to maintain a consistent color scheme and typography throughout the project. This made it easier to manage and update styles.

3. **Flexbox and CSS Grid**: I practiced using Flexbox and CSS Grid to create responsive layouts. Flexbox was particularly useful for aligning items in a single dimension, while CSS Grid helped in creating complex, two-dimensional layouts.

4. **Responsive Design**: I implemented media queries to ensure the page looks good on different screen sizes, especially on mobile devices. This involved adjusting font sizes, margins, and layout structures.

5. **Font Management**: I learned how to include custom fonts using the `@font-face` rule in CSS, which allowed me to use specific fonts that matched the design requirements.

6. **CSS Reset**: I applied a CSS reset to remove default browser styles, ensuring a consistent look across different browsers.

7. **List Styling**: I learned how to style lists and list items, including customizing list markers and adding padding to ensure proper alignment.

Here is an example of a code snippet that demonstrates some of these learnings:

```html
<ul class="prep-list">
  <li><span>Total:</span> Approximately 10 minutes</li>
  <li><span>Preparation:</span> 5 minutes</li>
  <li><span>Cooking:</span> 5 minutes</li>
</ul>
<tr>
  <td data-cell="nutrient">Calories</td>
  <td data-cell="nutrient-value">277kcal</td>
</tr>
```

```css
[data-cell="nutrient-value"] {
  color: var(--clr-Nutmeg);
  font-weight: var(--fw-600);
}
```
